//
//  CrossEngineStructureTranslator.swift
//  TablePro
//
//  Says one engine's table in another engine's terms.
//
//  It rewrites nothing the target driver already owns. Quoting, the primary
//  key clause, index and foreign key syntax, `SERIAL` versus `AUTO_INCREMENT`
//  versus `IDENTITY` are all decided by `generateCreateTableSQL` on the target
//  side, and were already correct. What was source-native and reached the
//  target unchanged is the list here: the type spelling, the default
//  expression, the character set, the generation expression and the index
//  kind. Translating exactly those is what turns a refusal into a copy.
//
//  Same-family pairs return the snapshot they were given, byte for byte, apart
//  from an index the target cannot write. A MySQL to MariaDB copy runs the
//  path it always ran, which is the only way a change this wide can be trusted
//  not to move what already worked.
