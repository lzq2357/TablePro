//  What a scope has to offer, by identity only.
//
//  The sheet lists objects before the user has chosen anything, so this reads
//  names rather than structures: `CompareMetadataService.tableReads` pays four
//  round trips per table for columns, indexes, foreign keys and metadata, which
//  is the right price to plan a copy and the wrong one to fill a checklist.
//
//  A routine carries its argument signature and a trigger its table, because
//  two overloads and two same-named triggers are two objects and the planner
//  keys on that identity.
