/// How much room the status bar has, and so how much of its chrome it draws.

/// The bar used to pin both of its clusters at full width, which made its own minimum wider than the
/// pane hosting it: the tab content column adopted that width, `sizingOptions = []` kept the need
/// invisible to Auto Layout, and SwiftUI centred the oversized column in the pane. Measured at the
/// window's own 720pt minimum with the sidebar open, the column ran 766pt inside a 440pt pane, so
/// 163pt was unreachable at each edge: the grid's row numbers and first column sat under the
/// sidebar, and the pagination cluster sat past the trailing edge. `ViewThatFits` picks the widest
/// tier whose ideal width fits, and `narrow` is measured to fit the narrowest pane the window
/// allows, so no tier can over-size the column again.

///
/// Only a control whose command has another route may leave: First and Last go, and the Query menu
/// carries all four page commands at every width. Nothing that opens a popover may go, because a
/// `.popover` anchored to a button that is no longer in the view tree cannot present, so giving up
/// the Highlight Rules button would have made `View > Highlight Rules…` do nothing at that width.
/// Rows-per-page has no menu-bar route at all, so it moves inside the page indicator rather than
/// leaving.

/// which controls a result offers, this one answers how they are drawn. Both are pure so the whole
/// matrix is decidable without mounting a view.
