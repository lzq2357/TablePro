//  MenuDisclosureIndicatorTests.swift
//  TableProTests
//
//  A SwiftUI `Menu` on macOS is an `NSPopUpButton` carrying its own `NSPopUpIndicatorView`, and a
//  `ControlGroup`'s menu segment carries the same one. A chevron passed as the label becomes the
//  control's icon and lands beside that indicator rather than replacing it, so the control shows
//  two. Five shipped that way: the Run split button, the connection form's Tags row, the query
//  editor's scope picker and both AI chat pickers.
//
//  The two dead ones are the reason a reviewer cannot catch this by reading. SwiftUI reduces a
//  macOS menu label to one image plus one text and silently drops the rest, so a chevron written
//  after an icon and a title renders nothing at all, and the source looks identical either way.
//
//  The second suite guards the name rather than the glyph, and it is the same kind of trap: the
//  modifier that looks like it supplies a name is the one that removes it.
